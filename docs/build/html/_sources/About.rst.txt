gutSMASH is an algorithm that enables to systematically evaluate the metabolic potential of anaerobic bacteria by predicting both known and putative Metabolic Gene Clusters (MGCs). This tool is specifically designed to uncover MGCs that are involved in specialized primary metabolism from the gut microbiome that have been associated to microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions. Moreover, gutSMASH also predicts energy-capturing-related MGCs, to evaluate the mechanisms bacteria employ to harvest energy. To be able to detect these MGCs, gutSMASH uses detection rules logic as antiSMASH, that are Pfam combination defining of a specific reaction.
