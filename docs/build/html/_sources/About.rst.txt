gutSMASH is an algorithm that enables to systematically evaluate the metabolic potential of anaerobic bacteria by predicting both known and novel anaerobic Metabolic Gene Clusters (MGCs). This tool is specifically designed to uncover MGCs are involved in specialized primary metabolism from the gut microbiome that have been associated to microbe-microbe and host-microbe interactions. To be able to detect these clusters, gutSMASH uses detection rules logic, as antiSMASH, that are Pfam combination that are defining of a specific reaction.
