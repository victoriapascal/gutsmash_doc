Cluster Classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The anaerobic metabolic pathways that gutSMASH predicts can be divided into different gene cluster classes based on the key reaction:
	
 - ``OD``: Oxidative decarboxylation (e.g.: porA pathway)
 - ``DR``: Dehydratase/Reductase (e.g.: Leucine reduction into butyrate)
 - ``GR``: Glycyl-radical dependent (e.g.: Propanediol degradation operon)
 - ``FE``: Flavoenzymes dependent (e.g.: *bai* operon)
 - ``Others``: pathways that don't fit in any other categories are classified in here (e.g.: Lysine degradation pathway)


Custer Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^
gutSMASH uses some abbreviations internally to refer to the different types of primary metabolite clusters:
 - Trimethylamine degradation pathway (*tma* cluster)
 - Putative glutamate to butyric acid 
 - Propanediol utilization pathway (*pdu* operon)
 - Proline to 5-aminovalerate cluster
 - P-cresol cluster (*hpdBCA* operon)
 - Lysine degradation pathway (to butyrate)
 - Leucine reductive branch to butyrate (from *Clostridioides difficile* and *Clostridium sporogenes*)
 - Ethanolamine pathway (*eut* operon)
 - Aromatic Amino Acid reductive branch
 - Acetate to butyrate
 - Arginine degradation pathway (via agmatine to spermidine)
 - Arginine degradation to putrescine
 - Arginine to hydrogen-carbonate 
 - 7a-dehydroxylation pathway (*bai* operon)
 - Gallic acid metabolism
 - Caffeate respiration
 - Carnitine degradaion (*caiTABCDE* operon)
 - Aminobutyrate to butyrate
 - Succinate to propionate
 - Acrylate to propionate
 - Threonine to propionate (*tdcABCDEFG* operon)
 - Hydroxybenzoate to phenol (*hadBCD* operon)
 - Glycine reductase
 - Glycine cleavage
